                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">Teenage pregnancies have a number of problems:
<br>
<br>There is a higher risk that babies born from teenage mothers are born too early, or that they have a low weight at birth.
<br>The mothers may also encounter complications or difficulties at birth; they have a higher risk of anaemia than mothers aged 20â€“24. 
<br>A pregnancy is best followed by trained medical staff during its course. Teenage mothers are less likely to receive prenatal care, often seeking it in the third trimester, if at all. The Guttmacher Institute reports that one-third of pregnant teens receive insufficient prenatal care and that their children are more likely to suffer from health issues in childhood or be hospitalized than those born to older women.
<br>Like most other teenagers, teenage mothers may suffer from poor nutrition. This may lead to them having specific illnesses related to bad nutrition. Bad nutrition is a more marked problem of teenagers in developed countries.
<br>Up to 70,000 teen girls in developing countries die from complications during pregnancy each year. Young mothers and their babies are also at greater risk of contracting HIV. The World Health Organization estimates that the risk of death following pregnancy is twice as high for women between 15 and 19 years than for those between the ages of 20 and 24. The maternal mortality rate can be up to five times higher for girls aged between 10 and 14 than for women of about twenty years of age. Illegal abortion also holds many risks for teenage girls in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa.
<br>Risk for complications are higher for girl 14 years or younger, because their pelvis has not yet developed fully; this may lead to probems with childbirth. Some of these problems can be dealt with using Cesarean section (C Section)This requires the services of a doctor, or a hospital, which is often unavailable. Where this is unavailable, eclampsia, obstetric fistula, infant mortality, or maternal death can result. For mothers in their late teens, age in itself is not a risk factor, and poor outcomes are associated more with socioeconomic factors rather than with biology.</p>
